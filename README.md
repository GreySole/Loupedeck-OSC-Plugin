# Loupedeck OSC Plugin
Sends OSC messages to a defined IP and port. Create a Set Defaults command to save a default ip and port to file. Then all buttons and knobs will send to that port and ip.
- Create basic, toggle, and momentary buttons
- Create raw knobs that send an unconstrained accumilation or a normal knob that goes from 0-100
- Create custom knob to set your own min, max, and step
